# Project Description

Cups is a local coffee shop that provides a relaxing getaway in the middle of the city for the disabled community. They are also a wonderful example of a Social Enterprise Boost Initiative (https://www.micaf.gov.jm/msme-initiatives/social-enterprise-boost-initiative-sebi) similar to DeafCan coffee (https://www.deafcancoffee.com/ | https://youtu.be/gGYq0ASoEPM ). Kat, the manager, has been encouraged by her mentor to establish another store at 95 Moolean Avenue in the heart of Montego Bay. Kat would like to encourage an empowering environment through self service. Your consulting team providing pro bono services has considered to incorporate Artificial Intelligence through Computer Vision and Speech Processing to accomplish this. The touch-screen self service kiosk will allow customers to order their favourite treats and verify using their Digital Id.

# Getting Started

## Installing Prerequisites

1. [MongoDb](https://docs.mongodb.com/)

   MongoDb is a non-relational database. We will be using this to store all the necessary data for the application.

   Before you can use it however, you need to install it locally. Click this [link](https://www.mongodb.com/download-center/community?jmp=docs) and follow the setup instructions.

2. [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/)

   Node is a tool used to run javascript on other platforms outside of the browser. For example, on a server.

   Once again you will need to install this before you can use it. Here is the [link](https://nodejs.org/en/download/). Once on the page, select the windows installer (assuming you're using Windows), and follow the setup instructions.

3. [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)

   Yarn is a popular package management tool for javascript applications and the one we will be using for this project.

   Download the installer from [this](https://legacy.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/#windows-stable) page and once again follow the setup instructions

4. [Nodemon](https://nodemon.io/)

   For this one all you need to do is open up a terminal, i.e. command prompt, and run the following command `npm install -g nodemon`.

   It is just a simple to make your life easier when running the backend server, as you will see later.

## Running the frontend application

Open your command prompt/terminal and navigate into the directory containing this project.

Run the following commands to get started

`yarn install` This command installs all of the packages necessary to run the app

`yarn start` This command will start the app and run it on http://localhost:3000

## Running the backend application

Open your command prompt/terminal and navigate into the directory containing this project and then navigate further into the backend directory.

Run the following commands to get started:

`yarn install` Once again, this command installs all of the packages necessary to run the app

`yarn start` This command starts the server for the application on http://localhost:5000 by default

To test this simply navigate to http://localhost:5000

**NB:** If you have any questions, you know who to call ; ) . Or just google it, you're gonna need to practice that as well.

**Happy Coding!!!**
