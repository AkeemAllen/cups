# Getting Started

## Installing Prerequisites

1. [MongoDb](https://docs.mongodb.com/)

   MongoDb is a non-relational database. We will be using this to store all the necessary data for the application.

   Before you can use it however, you need to install it locally. Click this [link](https://www.mongodb.com/download-center/community?jmp=docs) and follow the setup instructions.

2. [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/)

   Node is a tool used to run javascript on other platforms outside of the browser. For example, on a server.

   Once again you will need to install this before you can use it. Here is the [link](https://nodejs.org/en/download/). Once on the page, select the windows installer (assuming you're using Windows), and follow the setup instructions.

3. [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)

   Yarn is a popular package management tool for javascript applications and the one we will be using for this project.

   Download the installer from [this](https://legacy.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/#windows-stable) page and once again follow the setup instructions

4. [Nodemon](https://nodemon.io/)

   For this one all you need to do is open up a terminal, i.e. command prompt, and run the following command `npm install -g nodemon`.

   It is just a simple to make your life easier when running the backend server, as you will see later.

## Running the frontend application

Open your command prompt/terminal and navigate into the directory containing this project.

Run the following commands to get started

`yarn install` This command installs all of the packages necessary to run the app

`yarn start` This command will start the app and run it on http://localhost:3000

## Running the backend application

Open your command prompt/terminal and navigate into the directory containing this project and then navigate further into the backend directory.

Run the following commands to get started:

`yarn install` Once again, this command installs all of the packages necessary to run the app

`yarn start` This command starts the server for the application on http://localhost:5000 by default

To test this simply navigate to http://localhost:5000

**NB:** If you have any questions, you know who to call ; ) . Or just google it, you're gonna need to practice that as well.

**Happy Coding!!!**
